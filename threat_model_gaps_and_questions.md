# Threat Model: Potential Gaps & Key Questions

## 1. Potential Gaps / Missed Areas

- **Third-party Integrations:** Are there any third-party services (analytics, monitoring, plugins) integrated with Sprinklr or client apps that could introduce new attack surfaces?
- **Mobile Clients:** Is the live chat SDK or authentication flow used in mobile apps? Are mobile-specific threats (reverse engineering, insecure storage) considered?
- **Incident Response:** Is there a defined process for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents (e.g., token compromise, data breach)?
- **Logging & Monitoring:** Are all critical actions (auth, data access, uploads) logged and monitored for anomalies? How is log integrity ensured?
- **Key Management:** How are encryption keys, API keys, and secrets managed, rotated, and revoked?
- **User Privacy:** Are privacy requirements (GDPR, CCPA) considered for end-user data, chat logs, and uploaded content?
- **LLM Abuse:** Are there controls to prevent LLM misuse (e.g., prompt injection, data exfiltration via chat responses)?
- **Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention:** Are there protections against brute force, credential stuffing, or API abuse at all endpoints?
- **Session Management:** How are user sessions invalidated on logout, password change, or suspected compromise?
- **Supply Chain Security:** How is the SDK distributed and updated? Are there controls to prevent supply chain attacks?
- **Data Retention & Deletion:** What is the policy for retaining and deleting chat logs, uploaded knowledge, and user data?
- **Multi-region/Geo Compliance:** Are there data residency or cross-border data flow considerations?
- **Accessibility:** Are there any security implications for accessibility features (screen readers, keyboard navigation)?
- **Insider Threats:** Are there controls to detect and prevent malicious actions by privileged users (Sprinklr staff, client admins)?

## 2. Key Questions to Clarify

- What is the exact authentication flow for end users and clients? Are there any fallback or legacy auth methods?
- How are tokens issued, stored, and invalidated? What claims are included in the tokens?
- What is the process for onboarding new clients? Is there a manual review or automated checks?
- How is tenant isolation enforced at the database, LLM, and WebSocket layers?
- Are all communications (including WebSocket, file uploads) encrypted end-to-end?
- How are uploads (FAQ, knowledge graph) validated and sanitized? Is there a file type/size restriction?
- What is the process for rotating or revoking API keys and secrets?
- How are LLM outputs monitored for sensitive data leakage or abuse?
- Are there regular security reviews, penetration tests, or code audits?
- How are dependencies (SDK, libraries) vetted and updated?
- What is the disaster recovery plan in case of major service compromise?
- Are there any known limitations or accepted risks in the current architecture?
- How is user consent for data processing and storage obtained and managed?
- Are there controls to prevent privilege escalation (e.g., end user gaining admin access)?
- How are error messages and logs handled to avoid information leakage?
