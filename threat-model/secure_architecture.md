### C. Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Supply Chain & SDK Delivery Attacks:**
  - Mitigation: Signed SDK delivery, SRI enforcement, strict domain whitelisting, secure HTTPS-only distribution, regular dependency audits, and rapid response to discovered vulnerabilities. Harden CSP and CORS policies to prevent unauthorized resource loading and cross-origin attacks.
- **Unauthorized Data Access:**  
  - Mitigation: Encryption at rest, strict access controls, audit logging.
- **Improper Data Retention/Deletion:**  
  - Mitigation: Automated retention policies, user-initiated deletion, compliance reviews.
- **Cross-Border Data Transfer:**  
  - Mitigation: Data residency controls, region-aware storage, contractual safeguards.
- **Lack of User Consent:**  
  - Mitigation: Consent management in partner apps, clear privacy policies.
- **Data Leakage via LLM/Agentic Flows or S2S Fetched Data:**  
  - Mitigation: Output filtering, data minimization, ephemeral storage, strict purpose limitation, and immediate deletion after use. Ensure no persistent logging of sensitive user data fetched from partner backends.
- **Cryptographic Isolation Failure (Key/Cert Leakage):**
  - Mitigation: Per-tenant key management, strict logical and physical separation of keys/certs, automated rotation, and monitoring. Compromise of one partner's keys or mTLS certificates must not impact other tenants. Use hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves for key storage where possible.

### D. Open Compliance Questions

- Are all data flows and storage locations documented and reviewed for compliance?
- How is user consent for data processing and storage obtained and tracked?
- Are data residency requirements configurable per partner/tenant?
- What is the process for fulfilling data subject access/deletion requests (DSARs)?
- How are compliance controls tested and audited?
- How is user data fetched via S2S/LLM Agentic flows handled, logged, and deleted? Is there any risk of inadvertent persistence or logging of sensitive data? Are ephemeral storage and deletion controls auditable?
- How is cryptographic isolation enforced between tenants? What is the process for detecting, containing, and remediating a key or certificate compromise for a single partner, and how is blast radius minimized?

## Service Availability, Disruption & Recovery

### A. Availability Threats

- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):** Attackers may attempt to overwhelm Sprinklr Live Chat or partner endpoints.
- **Infrastructure Failure:** Cloud provider outages, network partitioning, or hardware failures.
- **Software Bugs/Deployment Issues:** Faulty releases or misconfigurations causing service downtime.
- **Third-Party Dependency Outages:** LLM API providers, plugin services, or partner backends becoming unavailable.

### B. Mitigations

- **Redundancy & High Availability:** Multi-region deployment, load balancing, and failover for critical services.
- **Auto-Scaling & Rate Limiting:** Elastic scaling to absorb traffic spikes; rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Real-time health checks, synthetic monitoring, and alerting for anomalies.
- **Backups & Disaster Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data; tested DR plans for rapid restoration.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to basic chat or cached knowledge if LLM or partner backend is unavailable.

### C. Recovery & Operational Action Plan

- **Incident Response:** Defined escalation paths, on-call rotations, and runbooks for common failure scenarios.
- **RTO/RPO Targets:** Documented Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for each service.
- **Failover Procedures:** Automated and manual failover steps for regional or component-level outages.
- **Communication:** Stakeholder and partner notification protocols during major incidents.
- **Postmortem & Continuous Improvement:** Root cause analysis and remediation tracking after disruptions.

### D. Open Questions & Gaps

- Are DR and failover plans regularly tested and updated?
- Are all critical dependencies monitored for availability?
- Are SLAs/SLOs defined and communicated to partners?
- Is there a clear process for partner notification and support during outages?
- Are lessons learned from incidents fed back into operational improvements?

## Incident Response Plan

A robust incident response plan is essential for minimizing the impact of security incidents and ensuring rapid recovery. The following steps outline the incident response process for Sprinklr Live Chat:

### 1. Preparation
- Maintain up-to-date incident response runbooks and contact lists.
- Train staff on incident response roles and responsibilities.
- Ensure monitoring, alerting, and logging are in place for all critical systems.

### 2. Detection & Analysis
- Monitor for anomalous login/session activity, API usage, and suspicious admin or dashboard activity.
- Alert on multiple device logins, suspicious geolocations, failed or suspicious callback attempts, and unusual SDK download patterns.
- Analyze logs and alerts to confirm and classify incidents (e.g., data breach, DoS, privilege escalation).

### 3. Containment
- Isolate affected systems or accounts to prevent further damage.
- Revoke or rotate compromised credentials, tokens, or certificates.
- Block malicious IPs or disable vulnerable services as needed.

### 4. Eradication
- Remove malware, unauthorized access, or malicious changes from affected systems.
- Patch vulnerabilities and update configurations to prevent recurrence.

### 5. Recovery
- Restore affected services and data from clean backups.
- Validate system integrity and monitor for signs of continued compromise.
- Gradually return systems to normal operation.

### 6. Post-Incident Review
- Conduct a root cause analysis and document findings.
- Update incident response procedures and controls based on lessons learned.
- Communicate outcomes and improvements to stakeholders.

### 7. Communication & Reporting
- Notify affected partners and regulatory bodies as required.
- Maintain clear internal and external communication channels during incidents.
- Document all actions, decisions, and communications throughout the incident lifecycle.

### 8. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly test and update the incident response plan (e.g., tabletop exercises).
- Review and improve monitoring, detection, and response capabilities.
