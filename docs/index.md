## Documentation Structure

This documentation is organized to provide a clear, end-to-end view of the system, its security posture, and the methodologies used to ensure robust protection for both application and cloud environments.

### 1. System Design
- **Overview:** High-level architecture, main actors, and data flows.
- **Application Details:** Key components, integration points, and user journeys.
- **Functionalities:** Core and advanced features, including LLM-powered chat, admin dashboard, and partner integrations.

### 2. Security Architecture
- **Architecture:** Secure design principles, trust boundaries, and defense-in-depth strategies.
- **Threat Model (Application):** STRIDE-based analysis of application-level risks and mitigations.
- **Threat Model (Cloud):** Cloud infrastructure threat modeling, including AWS-specific risks and controls.
- **Secure Architecture:** Best practices for authentication, authorization, data protection, and secure deployment.
- **Incident Response:** Playbooks, monitoring, and response strategies for security events.

### 3. Threat Modeling Deep Dive
- **Overview:** Summary of the threat modeling approach, key definitions, and high-level diagrams.
- **Component-Level Threat Analysis:** Per-component threats, mitigations, and open questions.
- **STRIDE Threat Mapping:** Threat category mapping and detailed tables.
- **Data Storage & Compliance:** Data inventory, compliance matrix, and open compliance questions.
- **Service Availability & Recovery:** Availability threats, mitigations, and recovery plans.

### 4. Supporting Materials
- **Glossary:** Definitions of key terms, acronyms, and cloud/security concepts.
- **Diagrams:** System, data flow, and threat model diagrams (embedded throughout the docs).
- **References:** Links to standards, frameworks, and external resources.
