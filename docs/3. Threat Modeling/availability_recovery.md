# Service Availability, Disruption & Recovery

This section covers the main threats to service availability, mitigation strategies, and operational recovery plans for the Sprinklr Live Chat system.

---

## Availability Threats

- **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):** Attackers may attempt to overwhelm Sprinklr Live Chat or partner endpoints.
- **Infrastructure Failure:** Cloud provider outages, network partitioning, or hardware failures.
- **Software Bugs/Deployment Issues:** Faulty releases or misconfigurations causing service downtime.
- **Third-Party Dependency Outages:** LLM API providers, plugin services, or partner backends becoming unavailable.

---

## Mitigations

- **Redundancy & High Availability:** Multi-region deployment, load balancing, and failover for critical services.
- **Auto-Scaling & Rate Limiting:** Elastic scaling to absorb traffic spikes; rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **Monitoring & Alerting:** Real-time health checks, synthetic monitoring, and alerting for anomalies.
- **Backups & Disaster Recovery:** Regular backups of critical data; tested DR plans for rapid restoration.
- **Graceful Degradation:** Fallback to basic chat or cached knowledge if LLM or partner backend is unavailable.

---

## Recovery & Operational Action Plan

- **Incident Response:** Defined escalation paths, on-call rotations, and runbooks for common failure scenarios.
- **RTO/RPO Targets:** Documented Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) for each service.
- **Failover Procedures:** Automated and manual failover steps for regional or component-level outages.
- **Communication:** Stakeholder and partner notification protocols during major incidents.
- **Postmortem & Continuous Improvement:** Root cause analysis and remediation tracking after disruptions.

## Open Questions & Gaps

- Are DR and failover plans regularly tested and updated?
- Are all critical dependencies monitored for availability?
- Are SLAs/SLOs defined and communicated to partners?
- Is there a clear process for partner notification and support during outages?
- Are lessons learned from incidents fed back into operational improvements?
