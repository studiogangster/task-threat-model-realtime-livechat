- Session hijacking (stolen tokens, browser vulnerabilities)
- Phishing (credential theft, fake login pages)
- Session token compromise via XSS on partner domain if Sprinklr tokens are stored in localStorage or cookies
- Use of outdated or insecure browsers

**Mitigations:**
- Secure tokens (short-lived, bound to device/browser)
- HTTPS enforced for all communications
- User education and anti-phishing guidance
- Sprinklr session tokens must be stored only in memory (never in localStorage or cookies)
- Document and enforce this in SDK and integration guides
- Warn users on outdated/insecure browsers

**Known Security Gaps / Limitations:**
- Device-level compromise (malware/root) may bypass all browser-based controls
- Reliance on partner browser security for XSS/CSRF protection
- User behavior (e.g., falling for phishing) is hard to control

**Potential Impact / Failure Scenarios:**
- Compromised device can leak session tokens, credentials, or chat data
- Phishing may result in account takeover or impersonation
- XSS on partner domain could expose Sprinklr session tokens if not properly protected

**Incident Response & Monitoring:**
- Monitor for anomalous login/session activity
- Alert on multiple device logins or suspicious geolocations
- Provide rapid session/token revocation on suspected compromise

**Dependencies:**

- Dependency compromise

**Mitigations:**
- CSP
- Input validation
- SDK integrity checks
- Strict CORS policy
- Domain whitelisting
- Signed SDK delivery
- Subresource integrity (SRI)
- Regular dependency audits

**Known Security Gaps / Limitations:**
- If the partner app is compromised (e.g., via XSS), Sprinklr session tokens in memory may still be at risk.
- Reliance on partner-side enforcement for domain whitelisting and CORS; misconfiguration can expose APIs or SDK.
- Supply chain attacks on dependencies may not be detected immediately.
- If a partner app bans or revokes an end user's access during an active session, the user may continue to interact with Sprinklr until their short-lived session token expires (token revocation lag).

**Potential Impact / Failure Scenarios:**
- Successful XSS or supply chain attack could allow attackers to impersonate users, steal tokens, or manipulate chat.
- Misconfigured CORS or domain whitelist could allow unauthorized access to Sprinklr APIs or SDK.
- Dependency compromise could introduce malicious code into the partner app.
- Banned or deprovisioned users may retain access to live chat for the duration of their valid session token, potentially violating partner policy or compliance requirements.

**Incident Response & Monitoring:**
- Monitor for anomalous API usage patterns and failed CORS/domain checks.
- Alert on unusual SDK download patterns or integrity check failures.
- Rapidly revoke/rotate API keys and session tokens if compromise is detected.

**Dependencies:**
- Partner browser security (XSS, CSP enforcement)
- Sprinklr SDK integrity and update process

## Sprinklr SDK Security & Supply Chain

**Feature: Automatic SDK Updates (Hot Patching)**
- The Sprinklr SDK is delivered via a central CDN URL (e.g., CloudFront/S3). By updating the SDK at this location, all partner web apps automatically receive the latest version without requiring code changes or redeployment by the partner.
- This enables rapid rollout of security hot patches and critical fixes in response to emerging threats.

**Threats:**
- Supply chain attacks (malicious/tampered SDK, compromised dependencies)
- Unauthorized use of SDK by unapproved partners/domains
- SDK delivery via insecure channels (MITM, spoofing)
- Compromise of the SDK delivery pipeline could instantly impact all partners
- Unintended breaking changes or regressions due to auto-update

**Mitigations:**
- Serve SDK only over HTTPS with strong authentication and access control
- Use signed SDK bundles and enforce subresource integrity (SRI) in partner apps
- Maintain a domain/app whitelist for SDK access (enforced at delivery and runtime)
- Harden CSP and CORS policies to restrict resource loading and cross-origin requests
- Regularly audit SDK dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities
- Provide versioned SDKs and deprecate insecure versions promptly
- Audit logging and alerting for all SDK updates
- Strict access controls and multi-party approval for SDK publishing
- Option for partners to pin SDK versions for stability/compliance, with clear communication protocol for emergency hot patches
