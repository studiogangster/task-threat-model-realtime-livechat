# Q&A: Isolating End User Context in LLM Responses

## Question
How are we isolating the context of end users in case of LLM response?

## Tech Lead's Answer
Each LLM request is scoped to a single end user and partner context. The backend ensures that only data and context relevant to the requesting user and partner are included in the prompt sent to the LLM. No cross-user or cross-partner data is ever included in the same LLM session or prompt. Strict tenant and session isolation is enforced at all layers.

## Recommendation
Continue to enforce strict context isolation for all LLM requests. Regularly audit LLM prompts and responses for accidental data leakage.

## Risk
If context isolation fails, sensitive data from one user or partner could be exposed to another.

## Mitigation
- Enforce tenant and session checks before LLM invocation.
- Log and review LLM prompts for compliance.
- Use automated tools to detect context leakage.

## Incident Response Plan
- Immediately block affected LLM endpoints or sessions.
- Notify impacted users/partners.
- Audit and remediate isolation controls.
