# Q&A: SDK Integrity and Versioning

## Question
How are we ensuring integrity and versioning of our SDK artifacts?

## Tech Lead's Answer
All SDK artifacts are versioned and published with cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256). Partners are encouraged to verify hashes before use. CDN and S3 enforce immutability for released versions.

## Recommendation
Automate hash generation and verification in CI/CD. Communicate hash values to partners.

## Risk
If artifacts are tampered with, partners may load malicious code.

## Mitigation
- Enforce artifact immutability.
- Monitor for unauthorized changes.
- Provide hash verification tools.

## Incident Response Plan
- Invalidate compromised artifacts.
- Notify partners to update SDK.
- Investigate distribution pipeline.
